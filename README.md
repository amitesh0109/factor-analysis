# factor-analysis on cereal dataset.
Essentially conducted on a multidimensional dataset, that includes data regarding different cereal brands, and output of questions that were asked in a survey. Here, I've use PCA, which is not completely different from factor analysis, it get the jobs done.
The statistics involved is basically finding different principle components and using it to deduce different factors that effects a particular cereal brand.
